# Short term:

## Code:
  - [] Rename variables to more sensible names
  - [] Document every function
  - [] Generate graphs and save them
  - [] Save the model upon completion

## Infraestructure:
  - [] Write a requirements.txt


# Long term:

## Code:
  - [] Modularize code, such that we have different files, preferably
  - [] Switch from our own functions and external libs to tf's own
  - [] Include type notations in every function's input and output

## Infraestructure:
  - [] Pin python libraries in requirements.txt
  - [] Generate container images (easily done if the below is
        accomplished first)
  - [] Migrate to either Nix or Guix, so that the project can be run
        anywhere with a guarantee that people will have the same re-
        sults.
